            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence 
                by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared 
                radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers
                (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts for about 
                99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); 
                the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.<br>

                <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, 
                   the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the 
                   gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun 
                   within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This 
                   proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, 
                   usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, 
                   the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period 
                   of approximately 116 days.<br>

                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's 
                night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller than that 
                of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°, and thus it can be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a couple of 
                hours before or after sunrise or sunset, depending on the observer's latitude and on the positions of Venus and the Sun. Most of the time, 
                it can be seen either in the morning or in the evening. At some times, it may even be seen a while in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits 
                the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, 
                it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. 
                This means that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with
                Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.<br>

                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water 
                   can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up 
                   of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents 
                   and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, 
                   volcanoes and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting 
                   destructive solar winds.<br>

                   In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers 
                   to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a striking reddish appearance in the sky. Mars 
                   is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps.<br>

                   of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. People have been 
                   observing it since prehistoric times; it was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.<br>

                   with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.<br>

                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek 
                   mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the 
                   third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, 
                   and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, 
                   scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets<br>

                <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, 
                   the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its 
                   near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression 
                   of its atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being its near-twin Uranus).<br>

                <p>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. 
                   It was the first object to be discovered in the Kuiper belt, and remains the largest known body in that area. After Pluto was 
                   discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned 
                   following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris. 
                   This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define the term planet—excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as 
                   a dwarf planet.<br>>
